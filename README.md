# Aircraft Weight and Balance Calculator (MATLAB)

This project calculates the **weight and balance of an aircraft** using given input parameters.  
It was developed using MATLAB to apply aerospace engineering concepts related to mass properties and center of gravity analysis.


## Project Objective
- Compute aircraft weight and balance
- Calculate air density as a function of altitude
- Perform unit conversions required for flight calculations
- Apply MATLAB programming to aerospace problems

## Tools & Language
- **MATLAB**
- Script-based calculations
- Basic aerospace equations
